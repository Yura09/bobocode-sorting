### Merge sort vs Insertion sort
Merge sort works slowly when array is small (to 100 elements) or if array is partly sorted compared to
insertion sort.
Insertion sort works slowly when array is big or if array is reversed sorted 
So we should use merge sort when we operate a big amount of data.
and Insertion sort when array is partly sorted or when array doesnâ€™t have a lot elements

Merge sort uses more memory than insertion sort for creating new arrays
